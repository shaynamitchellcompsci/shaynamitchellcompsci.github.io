                	When enhancing my project, Weight, I have improved the software design and engineering section in multiple ways. I have improve the user interface on multiple screens of my mobile app. I have increased design best practices, for example, I have removed the thin box around the buttons on the weight log screen. I have changed the background to see which design works best, I have improved the stability and structure of the user interface, and I have improved the database retrieval as well as it’s handling in general. The entire mobile app has been improved and the complexity of the app has in turn been expanded upon. These enhancements have supported my completion of course outcomes. I have been able to demonstrate my ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. My skills in this area show that I can create a mobile app that delivers a solution that is both well-functioning and stylish to clients. 
	When enhancing my mobile app, I additionally improved upon the algorithms and data structures of my project as a whole. My app was not functioning as intended. Troubleshooting took a great amount of time, and I eventually was able to improve upon CRUD functionality. My program was only acting on Create and Read. This was not being implemented in a good way, only an okay implementation. I improved upon CRUD and enhanced the functionality of CREATE and READ, which took a lot of time. User input was also not impressive when beginning to enhance this project. I improved this area by creating reviewing SMS notifications sent to the user when they entered the wrong input on the login screen and the add weight screen. The inputs will now only accept the type of input I allow for this program. One other implementation I added was to improve data queries. I reviewed my add weight screen and my weightlog screen to see where I can improve the data queries. This improvement greatly increased the success of this app, allowing it to function the way I had originally intended it to function. I have been able to design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry specific goals. I have created an app that implements a good design, a working database, the ability to accept proper inputs, and the ability to organize, store, and display data efficiently to the user.
	The database is an area where I greatly improved my mobile app. Here I show where I can store, retrieve, and display data to users both efficiently and creatively. This project instills a modern minimalistic design that incorporates a well thought out database structure. To improve Weight, I modified the SQLight database schema. I organized it and in turn created a more efficient program. I solved multiple errors and issues that were causing my app to crash multiple times. In doing so, solving these problems allowed for a more impressive data retrieval ability. I was able to employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science through my enhancements on this project. I also was able to Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts by allowing myself to view my project from a new perspective. Design is important to me, and one cannot only rely on it. Having a well -functioning database is extremely important and I improved my skills greatly in both areas while enhancing this mobile app. 
	I have demonstrated that I am a professional who can develop professional quality software. I have been able to improve input validation and keep the program from crashing. I have enhanced the program so that it runs as it is designed to. I am confident that I will be able to create efficient applications that are emulated with well thought out design skills.
