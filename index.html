        <p>CS499 Capstone Course</p>


        <p>I.	Self-Introduction: Address all of the following questions to introduce yourself.

A.	How long have you been in the Computer Science program?
I began this program in 2021. I will be graduating this year. This program is very concentrated and I have covered a lot of information in the short time I have attended this school.

B.	What have you learned while in the program? List three of the most important concepts or skills you have learned.
I have learned that you can know a lot of general information about software development and be able to incorporate this information across multiple languages. I have also learned to research valuable and correct information to support my work, as well as, how important it is to organize and save your projects. Learning the software development lifecycle was an important part of my journey along with understanding the differences between waterfall and agile. 

C.	Discuss the specific skills you aim to demonstrate through your enhancements to reach each of the course outcomes.
I aim to demonstrate my skills pertaining to software engineering and design, algorithms and data structures, and databases by displaying an example of a project that will be improved upon in this course. This will highlight specific scenarios in which I showed my understanding of these three  topics in addition to my ability to consistently improve upon projects over time.  

D.	How do the specific skills you will demonstrate align with your career plans related to your degree?
My demonstarated skills will pertain to my degree and career in software development very well. These skills will highlight aspects that will be valuable in my career as a developer like consistency and flexibility as technology is always changing. 

E.	How does this contribute to the specialization you are targeting for your career?
My specialization in my career is full stack software development. This capstone highlighting my skills will prove how I will be of use as a full stack developer in the industry.</p>
