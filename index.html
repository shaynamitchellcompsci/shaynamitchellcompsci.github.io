        <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio!</h1>
        <p>CS499 Capstone Course</p>
<!-- Self-Introduction Section -->
<div class="section">
    <h2>Self-Introduction</h2>
    <p><strong>A. How long have you been in the Computer Science program?</strong><br>
    I began this program in 2021. I will be graduating this year. This program is very concentrated, and I have covered a lot of information in the short time I have attended this school.</p>

    <p><strong>B. What have you learned while in the program?</strong><br>
    I have learned that you can know a lot of general information about software development and be able to incorporate this information across multiple languages. I have also learned to research valuable and correct information to support my work, as well as how important it is to organize and save your projects. Learning the software development lifecycle was an important part of my journey, along with understanding the differences between waterfall and agile.</p>

    <p><strong>C. What specific skills do you aim to demonstrate?</strong><br>
    I aim to demonstrate my skills pertaining to software engineering and design, algorithms and data structures, and databases by displaying an example of a project that will be improved upon in this course. This will highlight specific scenarios in which I showed my understanding of these three topics in addition to my ability to consistently improve upon projects over time.</p>

    <p><strong>D. How do the specific skills you will demonstrate align with your career plans?</strong><br>
    My demonstrated skills will pertain to my degree and career in software development very well. These skills will highlight aspects that will be valuable in my career as a developer, such as consistency and flexibility, as technology is always changing.</p>

    <p><strong>E. How does this contribute to your specialization?</strong><br>

    <div class="scroll-box">
    My specialization in my career is full-stack software development. This capstone, highlighting my skills, will prove how I will be of use as a full-stack developer in the industry.hese enhanacements have portrayed my skills in these three areas and allow me to showcase what I can do in my career. These sections portray a culmination of all course outcomes by enhancing this project. I have decided to talk about my Mobile Development course where I created an app called Weight which is a weight tracking app. This project is from the CS 360 Mobile Architecture and Programming class. This app was created to be a simple tool for users to keep on their devices and help with every day tasks. The design is purposefully very simple and is designed to be very easy to use. Efficiency is very important with this project. When considering algorithms and data structures, this project will benefit from more structure. I will be completing and adding to the graphs that are already included in this application. Organization and efficiency in mobile app development is important in an app like Weight. These improvements will be beneficial to the project overall immensely.The app Weight utilizes graphs for data storage and also for the user to be able to keep track of their data. This organization will greatly improve the visualization and usability of Weight.Creating technically sound, professional quality, and efficient programs are very important skills to have. This project will show off these skills, as well as, the ability to exceed expectations in database design and algorithmic priniciples. These self assessments and code reviews allow me the chance to display my confidence as a developer, as well as, creativity and thoroughness in full stack development. Consistently working on a project is important and adding enhancements to Weight shows my ability to consistently follow through on full stack development projects in my career.The users I have identified to use this app are the following: Users generally monitoring weight for their health, fitness enthusiasts, and users looking to change their weight with a goal weight in mind. People sometimes have a hard time keeping their weight steady and need help monitoring it. General health is a great way to use this tracking app. These users are focused on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. This app can help them track their weight and make sure they are on a steady maintenance trajectory for a healthy lifestyle. Another category of users are enthusiastic about their fitness. They have weight gains they specifically want to reach. Each time they add a new weight, they may have went up on plates at the gym that month during bench presses or deadlifts, for example. They want to track their weight and are excited about it because they want to see visual progress of all of the hard work they have put into their work outs. This app can help them see their progress over time. The last category of user I am going to cover are those specifically looking to change their weight and have a goal in mind. These users are typically wanting to lose weight and know what weight they specifically want to reach. These users are looking for a way to keep them on track and accountable with each weigh in. This app can help them stay motivated in their weight goals and can even notify them as they hit their goals. All three types of users will enjoy the following functionalities of the app and in turn be able to reach their individual goals, accordingly.
Using this app is straightforward. It is simple in functionality and in user interface design. The app has a black background with white text. In later versions the user will be able to change the font and add a color of their choosing that will be applied to all buttons. The user first downloads the app. They first see the login screen where they either create a new account, or enter their username and password. There will always be a button on every screen in this app that allows the user to exit at any time. If the user entered valid credentials, they move on to the next screen. If this is their first time using the app, they see: ADD or Update weight? This will be the ADD or UPDATE weights screen. If they are a returning user, they see their previously logged weights in the WEIGHT LOG screen. The database will have three tables: daily weight entries, user login entries, and a goal weight entry. The returning user will see all three categories in the WEIGHT LOG. They will additionally be able to see the dates that all information was previously entered on. The returning users are additionally given the option to ADD or UPDATE weights on the WEIGHT LOG screen. They can add weights as needed which includes the selection of measurement each entry. Some may want to add weights in lb, kg, or g, for example. If this is a valid entry each time, the weight is stored in the database and the user is sent to the weight goal screen. If the entry is invalid, they are taken back to the ADD or UPDATE weights screen. Once the goal weight is set, the background processes compare this current weight with the goal weight. If they have reached their goal weight, the notification process sends them the following notification: “Congratulations! You have reached your goal weight.” If the goal weight has not been achieved yet, the app simply carries on as usual. The update weight works the same way as the add weight. Both processes will update in the database. The update weight process also has the same invalid entry check in place. All screens and features described in this first installment of the app coordinate in creating a user-centered user interface design. 
Users will have the ability to track their weight over time and watch themselves get closer to their set weight goal. They will enjoy the app because it will be so responsive and simple to use. Entering in their weights will be so quick they won’t feel it is taking their attention away from important things in their life and may even be able to multitask while using the app. The sleek user interface will not distract them from their goals or their life.</p>
