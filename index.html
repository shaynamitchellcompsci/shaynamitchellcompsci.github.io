    <h2>Self-Introduction</h2>
    <p><strong>A. How long have you been in the Computer Science program?</strong><br>
    I began this program in 2021. I will be graduating this year. This program is very concentrated, and I have covered a lot of information in the short time I have attended this school.</p>

    <p><strong>B. What have you learned while in the program?</strong><br>
    I have learned that you can know a lot of general information about software development and be able to incorporate this information across multiple languages. I have also learned to research valuable and correct information to support my work, as well as how important it is to organize and save your projects. Learning the software development lifecycle was an important part of my journey, along with understanding the differences between waterfall and agile.</p>

    <p><strong>C. What specific skills do you aim to demonstrate?</strong><br>
    I aim to demonstrate my skills pertaining to software engineering and design, algorithms and data structures, and databases by displaying an example of a project that will be improved upon in this course. This will highlight specific scenarios in which I showed my understanding of these three topics in addition to my ability to consistently improve upon projects over time.</p>

    <p><strong>D. How do the specific skills you will demonstrate align with your career plans?</strong><br>
    My demonstrated skills will pertain to my degree and career in software development very well. These skills will highlight aspects that will be valuable in my career as a developer, such as consistency and flexibility, as technology is always changing.</p>

    <p><strong>E. How does this contribute to your specialization?</strong><br>

<p><strong>E. How does this contribute to your specialization?</strong><br></p>

<div class="scroll-box">
    <p>
        My specialization in my career is full-stack software development. This capstone, highlighting my skills, 
        will prove how I will be of use as a full-stack developer in the industry. These enhancements have portrayed 
        my skills in these three areas and allow me to showcase what I can do in my career. These sections portray 
        a culmination of all course outcomes by enhancing this project.
